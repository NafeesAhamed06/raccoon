              This website and the materials and products on this site are

              implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
              purpose and non-infringement. ‘<strong>Raccoon App</strong>’ does
              not represent or warrant that the functions contained in the

              terms of their correctness, accuracy, adequacy, usefulness,
              timeliness, reliability or otherwise. Some states do not permit

              may not apply to you.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>
              ‘<strong>Raccoon App</strong>’ shall not be liable for any special
              or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the

              the products, even if ‘<strong>Raccoon App</strong>’ has been

              allow the limitation of exclusion of liability or incidental or
              consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
              not apply to you.

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ‘<strong

            <h2>Third-Party links</h2>
            <p>
              In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, ‘<strong
                >Raccoon App</strong
              >’ may link to sites operated by third parties. However, even if
              the third party is affiliated with ‘<strong>Raccoon App</strong>’,
              ‘<strong>Raccoon App</strong>’ has no control over these linked
              sites, all of which have separate privacy and data collection
              practices, independent of ‘<strong>Raccoon App</strong>’. These
              linked sites are only for your convenience and therefore you
              access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, ‘<strong
                >Raccoon App</strong
              >’ seeks to protect the integrity of its website and the links
              placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its
              own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a
              specific link does not work).

            <h2>Do we use ‘Cookies’?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider
              transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser
              (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s
              systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
              information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and
              process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to
              help us understand your preferences based on previous or current
              site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved
              services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data
              about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer
              better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract
              with third-party service providers to assist us in better
              understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not
              permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to
              help us conduct and improve our business. You can choose to have
              your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you
              can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your
              browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox or Safari)
              settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your
              browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
              If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features
              that make your site experience more efficient and some of our
